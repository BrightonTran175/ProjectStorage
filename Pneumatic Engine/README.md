Compact Pneumatic Engine Prototype

This project included the design, manufacturing, construction, testing and analysis of a small-sized working pneumatic engine as a proof of concept. During the process, My team was required to adhere to a set of regulations in terms of the engine's dimensions, material make-up, allowable manufacturing methods, functionality and efficiency. This project also had a time limit of 10 weeks, with 3 hour weekly workshops to utilise manufacturing tools such as drill presses, lathes and mills.

The engine works through a double piston 'wobbler', with a single hole in each piston acting as both an exhaust and intake. The pistons work out-of-phase by a half rotation in order to ensure a constant power stroke, maximising efficiency.

The project functioned as designed, however, improvements were considered in hindsight upon the completion of the project in terms of all above factors.
